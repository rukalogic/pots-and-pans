# Pots and Pans

**Pots and Pans** is a number-guessing logic game inspired by *Bulls and Cows*.  
The computer picks a secret code, and your job is to crack it using deduction and pattern recognition.

After every guess, you get clues:  
- **Pots** – correct digits in the correct position  
- **Pans** – correct digits in the wrong position  

Made with ❤️ in **C#**.  
Hope you enjoy playing it :)
