# PotsAnPots and Pans is a number-guessing logic game inspired by Bulls and Cows. The computer picks a secret code, and your job is to crack it using deduction and pattern recognition. After every guess, you get clues: “pots” for correct digits in the correct position, and “pans” for correct digits in the wrong position.
Made with C#, hope you try it :)
